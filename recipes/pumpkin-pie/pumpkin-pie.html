    <h3>Cindy's Pumpkin Pie</h3>
    <p>This pumpkin pie recipe uses melted ice cream instead of evaporated milk. The result is delicious. I have never brought home leftovers of this pie. I recommend using fresh pumpkin, but canned pumpkin can also be used.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 and a half pints of vanilla ice cream, softened</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>2 (9 inch) unbaked pie shells</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C.) Place ice cream near the warm oven to soften.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs. Stir in the pumpkin puree, sugar, salt, cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg. Mix in soft ice cream until smooth. Pour filling into two 9 inch pie shells.</li>
        <li>Bake for 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake an additional 30 to 40 minutes, or until filling is set.</li>
    </ol>
