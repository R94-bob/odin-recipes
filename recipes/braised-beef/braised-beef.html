    <h3>Braised Beef</h3>
    <p>An elevated version of homestyle pot roast, this braised beef is hearty and full of earthy richness. It would pair well with mashed potatoes, buttery noodles, or crusty bread.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 cupt red wine</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Season beef pieces evenly on all sides with 3 1/2 teaspoons salt, 2 teaspoons pepper, and garlic powder.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add beef, reduce heat to medium high and cook, undisturbed until it releases easily from the skillet and a golden brown crust has formed, about 4 minutes. Flip pieces and continue to cook until browned on all sides. Remove meat from the pan and set aside.</li>
